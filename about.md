My research focuses on the interactions between humans, climate and (tropical) ecosystems. My 
main expertise is tropical palynology, where I use pollen, spore and non-pollen palynomorph data to 
reconstruct past vegetation dynamics. I apply these paleoecological techniques to study long-term 
ecological change (e.g. biodiversity patterns, alternative stable states), to make assessments of the 
impact of Global Change (e.g. invasive species, climate extremes), to resolve contemporary issues 
(e.g. position of upper forest line in Ecuador), or to trace the impact of human societies in the past 
(e.g. extinction debt, fire history, rewilding in Mauritius and Madagascar). I aim to produce high 
detailed and robust reconstructions of the past and to provide perspectives for the future by 
integrating techniques and concepts across different fields, such as paleoclimatology, archeology, 
geochemistry, biogeography and restoration.
